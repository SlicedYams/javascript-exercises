- throws error with negative numbers
- throws error with non-integer numbers
- throws error with non-number parameters
- works with a larger number as starting number

sum(starting number (a), ending number (b)):
    create variable to hold sum

    if type of a or b is not number:
        return "ERROR"
    if ((a or b mod 1 is not 0) or (a or b is negative)):
        return "ERROR"
    if a > b:
        create variable to hold a value
        a = b
        b = a
    for (starting at a, while a is not greater than b, a++):
        sum += a
